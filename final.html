        Welcome to Blooming!
      </div>
      <div class="p1">
        In Blooming, you will enter a magical garden and explore the delicate 
        cycles and ecological balance of the natural world. This unique game allows 
        you to experience the fascinating interaction between the life cycle of 
        flowers and the flow of energy. Each area is randomly assigned with 
        flowers or fertilizer, and your task is to trigger the cycles and guide
        the growth and decay of the flowers. When flowers lack nutrients, they
        wither and transform into fertilizer, providing valuable nourishment to
        the surrounding flowers. However, when the nutrients around the flowers 
        become excessive, they also wither due to nutrient overload, transforming 
        into fertilizer. But the story doesn't end there...
      </div>
      <div class="p2">
        Fertilizers also have their own cyclic life cycle. When the nutrients around 
        the fertilizer are abundant, they burst into new life, growing into fresh blossoms. 
        At the same time, flowers also spread as seeds, allowing the surrounding fertilizers 
        to grow into new flowers.
      </div>
      <div class="p3">
        In Blooming, you will face challenges and make decisions. Observe the quantity 
        relationship between flowers and fertilizers, strategically position them to 
        trigger the perfect cycle. Master the art of cycles, and you will witness the 
        miracle of beautiful flowers growing, thriving, and spreading in the garden.
      </div>
      <div class="p4">
        Are you ready to explore this garden full of cyclic mysteries? Dive into the world 
        of Blooming now and discover the beauty of nature and the endless path of cycles!
